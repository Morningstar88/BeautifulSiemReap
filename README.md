# BeautifulSiemReap

Hello! We want to raise 500 dollars to collect trash in Siem Reap. This town is beautiful, but there is little trash collection system in the suburbs.

We want to pay local Khmer people 10USD per hour to collect and bag trash. We will use any extra funds to plant trees. We aim to keep Siem Reap beautiful, 
set up a system for the future, and create jobs for Khmer people.
